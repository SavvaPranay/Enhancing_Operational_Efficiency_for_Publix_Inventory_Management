# Enhancing_Operational_Efficiency_for_Publix_Inventory_Management
#Project Overview: This repository contains all the project materials for the "Enhancing Operational Efficiency for Publix Inventory Management" initiative. The project aims to streamline and optimize the inventory management processes at Publix, focusing on reducing manual effort, improving efficiency, and enhancing product availability. The proposed solution leverages AI-driven automation to replace the current manual processes, leading to significant reductions in waste and cycle time, as well as improved cost efficiency.

#Key Features:

As-Is Process: Documented the existing manual inventory management process at Publix, which involves manual monitoring of inventory levels, calculation of metrics, and decision-making for purchasing or restocking inventory.
To-Be Process: Introduced an AI-driven process that automates metrics calculation, inventory purchasing, and restocking, significantly improving operational efficiency.
Process Diagrams: Includes detailed AS-IS and TO-BE swim lanes, context diagrams, and process levels (0-4) to visualize the current and proposed processes.
IBM Simulation Results: Provides a comparative analysis between the AS-IS and TO-BE processes, highlighting improvements in cycle time (92.92% reduction) and cost efficiency (38.46% reduction).
Impact of Automation: Discusses the benefits of automation, including error reduction, improved order processing, enhanced time management, and cost savings.
Implementation Strategy: Outlines a phased rollout plan, including pilot testing, training, support, and risk management strategies.
Lessons Learned: Shares key insights gained during the project, such as the importance of data integrity, adaptive project management, and stakeholder engagement.
